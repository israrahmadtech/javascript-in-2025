// THEORY

// Javascript: Programming language used to communicate with machine.

// Interpreter - line by line execution
// Compiler: Converts(translates) Javscript(high level language) code into machine language at run time

// Single Thread : Run on one(single) thread of the processor - one core have two threads(one core can do two tasks at a time because it has two threads)

// Synchronous: Second task will wait untill the fist task is done(2nd task cannot be done before first)

// JIT: Just in time compilation(Interpreting and compilation woks separatly)


// Javascript is dynamic typed language means you can change data type of variable at run time
