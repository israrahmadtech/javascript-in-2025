// THEORY

// Javascript: Programming language used to communicate with machine.

// Interpreter - line by line execution
// Compiler: Converts(translates) Javscript(high level language) code into machine language at run time

// Single Thread : Run on one(single) thread of the processor - one core have two threads(one core can do two tasks at a time because it has two threads)

// Synchronous: Below statement will wait untill the above statement is done(below statement cannot be done before above statement)

// JIT: Just in time compilation(Interpreting and compilation works separatly)


// Javascript is dynamic typed language means you can change data type of variable at run time


// console.log(window)
// Window: Whole javascript is available inside window object.

// \'  or \"  : used for inserting a quote

// console.log(typeof 213.213)  // return number, float concept is not available in js
